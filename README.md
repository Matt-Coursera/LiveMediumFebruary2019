# Live Training

This is an empty repo to initialize an R project for training courses
organized by
[Oâ€™Reilly](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/live-training/courses/medium-r-programming-beyond-the-basics/0636920246961/).

# Packages

To get started run the following code to install the latest version of
the necessary packages.

<div class="sourceCode">

<pre class='sourceCode r'><code class='sourceCode r'>
packages <- c(
    'coefplot', 
    'DBI', 
    'dbplyr', 
    'DT', 
    'ggthemes', 
    'glmnet', 
    'here', 
    'here', 
    'jsonlite', 
    'knitr', 
    'leaflet', 
    'leaflet', 
    'odbc', 
    'recipes', 
    'rmarkdown', 
    'rmarkdown', 
    'rprojroot', 
    'RSQLite', 
    'rvest', 
    'threejs', 
    'tidyverse', 
    'useful', 
    'usethis', 
    'UsingR', 
    'xgboost', 
    'xml2'
)
install.packages(packages)
</code></pre>

# Project Structure

Making use of RStudio projects greatly improves the user experience. To
facilitate this users should run the following code which will recreate
this project on their computer. Be sure to select the positive prompts
such as `yes`, `yeah`,
etc.

``` r
newProject <- usethis::use_course('https://github.com/jaredlander/LiveMediumFebruary2019/archive/master.zip')
```

After that runs successfully you will have a new folder holding the R
project that looks like this (the name in the image may be different).

If a new project **did not open** automatically, either double-click the
file called LiveMediumFebruary2019.Rproj or run the following line of
code.

``` r
rstudioapi::openProject(newProject)
```

After running this code, or double-clicking that file, you will be in an
RStudio Project called LiveMediumFebruary2019 (the name in the image may
be different). You can see this in the top right of RStudio.
